# About

My research interests include compilers, formal verification, and fabrication.
Even outside of the lab,
  programming is one of my favorite activities,
  though sometimes I struggle to fit personal projects into a tight schedule.
I also help organize our [running club](http://raceconditionrunning.com),
  attempt small knitting projects,
  and practice cooking vegan food.
I can juggle and solve Rubik’s cubes, but not at the same time.
Also, my name has a
  [wicked cool anagram](https://totalcrazyhack.net/anagram.html).

I spent six sunny years at
  [UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu) working on my PhD with
  my incredible advisor [Sorin Lerner].
Throughout grad school,
  Sorin set a stellar example of how remarkable
  research can be when you put students first,
  an example I strive to emulate.
I also learned many invaluable lessons
  from the great [Ranjit Jhala],
  especially when it comes to writing and presentation:
  less is more!

I graduated from
  [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu) back in Spring 2007 with
  degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics.
As an undergraduate,
  I was fortunate to perform research with [Suresh Jagannathan]
  on the SML compiler [MLton](http://mlton.org).
For our Honors Project,
  advised by [Antony Hosking],
  my good friend [Bill Harris] and I designed and implemented a
  domain specific language to control a giant neon sculpture over the web.
Over nearly three years,
  I ran the lab component of Purdue’s introductory Java programming course.

## Miscellaneous

We have a great running group,
  [Race Condition Running](http://raceconditionrunning.com),
  that trots all over Seattle and gets brunch each week.

I am a big fan of Baja hoodies.
Luckily the [PLSE] faculty also have incredible fashion sense.

I help out with a bunch of stuff around the Allen School,
  including [TGIF](https://sites.google.com/cs.washington.edu/tgif/).
Sometimes [famous guests](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/) swing by :)

I also help
  [Hank Levy](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/levy)
  and [Adriana Schulz] write the annual faculty skit where we
  dress up and try to take things a little less seriously.

There is always something happening in the Allen School;
it can be tricky to juggle everything going on &#x1F939;
