My goal is to help students become great computer scientists.
For research,
  I work toward this goal with my [students](students.html)
  in the [PLSE] and [SAMPL] groups,
  and as part of the SRC-funded [ADA JUMP Center][ADA].
For education,
  I work toward this goal by [teaching courses](teaching.html) on
  programming languages and related topics.
I am also part of the incredible team at [OctoML].

  or want blazing fast optimization, check us out!
