Howdy!
My goal is to help students become great computer scientists.
On the research side,
I work toward this goal in the [PLSE] and [SAMPL] groups,
and as part of the SRC-funded [ADA JUMP Center][ADA].
On the teaching side,
I work toward this goal by [teaching courses][teaching] on
programming languages and related topics.

I am also part of the incredible team at [OctoML].
If you like hacking on machine learning compilers and systems
or want blazing fast optimization, check us out!
