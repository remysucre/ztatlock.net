My goal is to help students become great computer scientists.
For research,
  I work toward this goal with my [students](students.html)
  in the [PLSE] and [SAMPL] groups,
  and as part of the SRC-funded [ADA JUMP Center][ADA].
For education,
  I work toward this goal by [teaching courses](teaching.html) on
  programming languages and related topics.
I am also part of the incredible team at [OctoML].

  or want blazing fast optimization, check us out!

TODO

Computer programming is a huge success;
 it plays a major role in
 most modern problem solving.
However, for some problems
 we still have trouble writing programs
 that reliably do the right thing.
My research improves software reliability by
 developing tools that help programmers
 ensure their code is safe and accurate.

My students and I focus on important programs,
 including the software infrastructure
 that many other programs rely on
 (compilers, distributed systems, networks);
 control programs in safety-critical applications
 (radiotherapy devices);
 and approximations used in engineering and manufacturing
 (floating point, 3D printing).
We spend many hours
 working out proofs on the whiteboard,
 but we always build working systems.
We [release our code][PLSEGITHUB] so
 others can review and build on our work,
 and we get free food when we work late.

All our [papers](#publications) and [projects](#projects)
 are collaborations with incredible [colleagues](#collaborators).
Our home base is in the vibrant [UW PLSE][PLSE] group
 and we also have long term collaborations with
 [SAMPL][SAMPL_PROJECT],
 [Syslab](https://syslab.cs.washington.edu/),
 the [Applications Driving Architectures (ADA)](https://adacenter.org/index.php/) Center,
 and the [SandCat Project](http://sandcat.cs.washington.edu/).
